In the country where people have to sell freedom of their mind to live in
society one woman lost connection with owner of her mind while testing the
aircraft, lost in sea, landed on the sea, caught in the storm, washed
ashore. A lot of monsters in that place. They can see magic. Some spells
use more or less magic than others. This woman can use hands to cast
spells. Amount of magic that can be used by any creature is limited, can be
increased by training, acquired from other creatures. Hide, fight, run, do
somethings else with monsters, find water and food, make tools, machines to
survive.
